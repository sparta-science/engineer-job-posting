## Full Stack Engineer (Elixir/Phoenix)- [Sparta Science](https://www.spartascience.com)
#### San Francisco, CA

Sparta Science can predict injuries before they happen. We identify athletes’ injury risks and recommend customized 
training plans to reduce the chance of injury. Our customers are professional and university sports programs (including 
NBA, NFL, MLB, and NCAA teams), hospitals, and the US military.

We’re looking to add full-stack engineers to our small, collaborative development team. You’d be a great fit if you are
comfortable working on both front-end and back-end code, like to pair program all day, like writing your tests first, 
enjoy constructive dialogue as much as shipping code, and are excited about regularly delivering a product that has an 
impact. Our app is written in Elixir, which we love because it combines a beautiful, Ruby-like syntax with substantial 
performance improvements. Working with us, you’ll have the opportunity to learn this cutting-edge language or to improve 
your existing skills. We use the Phoenix web framework and Elm for the complex parts of our UI.

We believe in working at a sustainable pace—you’ll typically code for 8 hours each day, and then you’re off to relax, 
recharge, and refocus. Our office is in SOMA, a 10-minute walk from BART and Caltrain. Due to our emphasis on in-person 
collaboration, working remotely is not possible for this role.

#### What you’ll bring to the table

- 2+ years of software development experience 
- Desire to work in a full-time pair-programming environment
- Desire to work on a team that practices TDD
- Strong interpersonal communication skills and the ability to work well with our team
- Passion for quality and writing clean, solid, readable code that scales and performs well
- Passion for improving your skills, tackling interesting work, and solving challenging problems

#### Nice-to-haves

- Experience with Elixir/Phoenix, Ruby on Rails, or Elm
- Experience with pair programming
- Experience with TDD
- Experience with agile/XP software development

#### Benefits

- Competitive salary and equity
- Health, dental, and vision
- 401(k)
